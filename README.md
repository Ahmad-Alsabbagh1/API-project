# API-project

This simple website is made using [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) API in a week for a small project, It can be used to look for wallpapers or just to browse some pictures.  
  
For the photographer's name you can hover over the wallpaper, for more information about the picture or if you wish to download it, you can click on the picture and it will direct you to the original picture on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) page. 
You are able to search with clicking the search button after typing or simply by hitting **Enter/Return** on your keyboard.
The search bar is **not** case-sensitive.  
  
When the 40 pictures are loaded a **"Next Page"** button will appear to load a next page with 40 other pictures if you want to see more results.  
The **"Next Page"** button is hidden when there is no more results then the ones visible on the screen.  
The **"Previous Page"** button only appears when you have have pressed the **"Next Page"** button and loaded another page if you would like to go back to the previous page.  
  
For handling errors, e.g.: no internet connection, the user will get an pop-up alert from the browser.  
Also a loading screen will show till the wallpapers are shown or when the user refreshes the page.   
The website is of course responsive and you can use it on : computer/laptop, Ipads/Tablets, and phones.
